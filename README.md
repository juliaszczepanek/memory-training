✨ <strong>Features</strong>

🧠 Cognitive Training: Three exercises (Number Span, Verbal Memory, Corsi Block) to enhance working memory.

📈 Performance Tracking: Results stored and visualized using interactive charts with Plotly.js.

🔐 Firebase Authentication: Secure login and user registration.

🗃️ Firestore Database: Data storage for exercise results and user statistics.

🎨 Custom UI: Designed entirely by myself in Figma, implemented using Material UI.
